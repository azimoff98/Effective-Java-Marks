# Noninstantiability with private constructors

**_Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by 
making a class abstract does
not work._** The class can be subclassed and 
the subclass instantiated. Furthermore,
it misleads the user into thinking the class was designed for inheritance

**_a class can be
made noninstantiable by including a private constructor**_


The AssertionError isnâ€™t strictly required, but it provides insurance in case the
constructor is accidentally invoked from within the class. It guarantees the class
will never be instantiated under any circumstances.

As a side effect, this idiom also prevents the class from being subclassed. All
constructors must invoke a superclass constructor, explicitly or implicitly, and a
subclass would have no accessible superclass constructor to invoke.
